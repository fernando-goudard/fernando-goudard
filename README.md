## Welcome!

**My name is Fernando Soares Goudard, and it is a pleasure to have you here.** I'm an **Electrical Engineering** graduate and work professionally in the field of Building Automation, with a career marked by technology, process analysis, and a constant search for improvement and innovation.

Throughout my professional experience, I have developed solid skills in requirements gathering and analysis, implementation of customized technical solutions, production of technical and functional documentation, as well as user support and customer relations. I also have experience with creating dashboards, technical reports, SQL database management, and technical presentations for different stakeholders.

Over time, I nurtured a strong interest in data analysis and data-driven decision-making. To further my knowledge in this area, I completed the **Data Analyst course at TripleTen**, where I gained practical experience with the entire data analysis flow. From data collection, cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing to exploratory analysis, statistical testing, visualization creation, and solving business problems with data.

During the course, I worked with tools and technologies widely used in the market, such as **Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, among others), SQL, Excel, and visualization and dashboard building tools like Dash and Tableau.** I also developed an analytical mindset focused on KPIs, clear communication of insights, and decision-making support.

In addition, I'm constantly seeking technical and academic improvement, having taken courses at renowned institutions, such as **Introduction to Data Analysis (CS109x) at Harvard**, reinforcing my foundation in **statistics, data analysis, and critical thinking.**

I'm a professional with **strong adaptability, clear technical communication, and a keen interest in applying data to generate real value.** If you want to exchange ideas, ask questions, or talk about data, technology, or projects, I would be happy to chat!
